## üîë Key Business Insights (The Data Story)
The analysis yielded three core insights crucial for strategic decision-making in the used car market:

### 1. Primary Price Driver: Odometer (Mileage)
* **Finding:** The Odometer reading is the most statistically significant variable affecting price, confirming a negative correlation (as mileage increases, price decreases).
* **Quantification:** Odometer accounts for approximately **34% of the average selling price variation** ($R^2 = 0.34$).
* **Actionable Takeaway:** Car valuation models must heavily weight the Odometer reading, as the average price drops by $\mathbf{\$0.23}$ for every unit increase in mileage.

### 2. Market Segmentation and Premium Pricing
* **Finding:** The market shows strong segmentation based on average selling price.
* **Evidence:** Luxury brands like **Rolls-Royce, Ferrari, and Lamborghini** command the highest average prices (exceeding $\mathbf{\$140K}$), clearly separating them from the mass-market brands.
* **Actionable Takeaway:** Sales strategies and inventory targeting must be tailored differently for the high-end, high-margin luxury segment versus the volume-driven mass market.

### 3. Sales Volume and Price Trend Over Time
* **Finding:** [Please write your final observation here after checking the **synchronized** lines on Sheet 3. Example: **"Sales volume (Count) shows a rapid increase over the period, peaking in early 2015, while Average Selling Price remained relatively stable."**]
* **Actionable Takeaway:** [Write your final recommendation here based on the finding above. Example: **"Investigate competition or supply chain factors that kept prices flat despite rising demand."**]

## üõ†Ô∏è Dashboard Design and Advanced Features
The dashboard was designed following best practices to ensure clarity and engagement:

* **Tool Used:** Tableau Public Edition.
* **Context and Storytelling:** Added dedicated **Text Boxes** to provide direct business context and highlight the key findings for each chart.
* **Advanced Analytics:** Used a **Linear Trend Line** to quantify price correlation (Sheet 1).
* **Advanced Visuals:** Utilized a **Synchronized Dual Axis** for the Sales Trend chart to accurately compare Sales Volume and Average Price over time (Sheet 3).
